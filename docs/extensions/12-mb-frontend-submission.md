import FAQ from '@site/src/components/FAQ';

MB Frontend Submission helps you create front-end forms for users to submit data to your website. It allows you to submit data for posts like post fields (title, content, etc.) and also custom fields created by Meta Box. It also support to custom table models and works with all extensions like [MB Group](/extensions/meta-box-group/) or [MB Conditional Logic](/extensions/meta-box-conditional-logic/).

## Submission form

### Adding the submission form

To add a submission form to a page, select the **Submission Form** block from the block inserter. And you'll see the form preview like this:

![Adding a form submission to a page with the Gutenberg block](https://i.imgur.com/PEI5I91.png)

Clicking on the block will reveal the form settings on the right. All settings are self-explained and have their description.

The plugin also provides a shortcode to insert the submission form into a page:

```php
[mb_frontend_form id="field-group-id" post_fields="title,content"]
```

You can also submit data to a [MB Custom Table](/extensions/mb-custom-table/) model:

```php
[mb_frontend_form id="field-group-id" object_type="model"]
```

If you're using [MB Builder](/extensions/meta-box-builder/), go to **Meta Box > Custom Fields** admin page and copy the content in the **Shortcode** column for the field group that you created:

![Copy submission form shortcode in MB Builder](https://i.imgur.com/sfeWhBA.png)

Below is the list of the settings. The attribute is used for the shortcode.

Name|Attribute|Description
---|---|---

### Hiding a field

When you set the form to display fields from a field group, all fields are displayed by default. If you want to hide a field from front-end forms, then you need to set a settings for it.

If you use [MB Builder](/extensions/meta-box-builder/) to build the field group, please enable the settings **Hide from front end** from the field's **General** settings tab:

![Hide a field from the front end](https://i0.wp.com/images.elightup.com/meta-box/docs/frontend-submission/hide-from-front.png)

If you use code to register fields, please set the field as follows:

```php
[
    'id'              => 'gallery',
    'name'            => 'Gallery',
    'type'            => 'image_advanced',
    // highlight-next-line
    'hide_from_front' => true,
]
```

### Dynamic population

The dynamic population feature allows you to dynamically populate a shortcode attribute with a value. This value can be passed via the query string and/or hook.

#### Query string

You can populate the post ID for the shortcode via the query string by appending the dynamic population parameter for the attribute to the end of your form URL along with your custom value.

```
https://example.com/form-url/?rwmb_frontend_field_object_id=123
```

The query parameter is `rwmb_frontend_field_object_id`.

Note that *only* object ID is supported for populating via query string since version 2.2.0.

#### Hooks

Shortcode attributes can also be populated via WordPress hooks. This example below changes the `post_id` to `123`:

```php
add_filter( 'rwmb_frontend_field_value_post_id', 'my_custom_population_function', 10, 2 );
function my_custom_population_function( $value, $args ) {
    if ( $args['id'] === 'your_meta_box_id' ) { // Only filter for a specific form.
        $value = 123;
    }
    return $value;
}
```

This snippet would be pasted in your theme's `functions.php` file or your plugin's PHP file.

The filter has the following format:

```php
$value = apply_filters( "rwmb_frontend_field_value_{$attribute}", $value, $args );
```

The callback function accepts 2 parameters: the attribute value and the array of all attributes. You should use `$args['id]` to check if you're filtering for the right form.

### Templates

The plugin allows you to use custom template files for post fields and the confirmation message.

The plugin will look for a template file in the following order:

- Inside a folder `mb-frontend-submission` of your child theme
- Inside a folder `mb-frontend-submission` of your parent theme
- In the plugin's `templates` folder

To overwrite the output of post fields, please follow the steps below:

- Create a folder `mb-frontend-submission` in your theme.
- Copy a template file that you want to change from the plugin's `templates` folder to the new `mb-frontend-submission` folder, keeping the same folder structure.
- Modify the new template file.

### Field order

Sometimes you want to **mix post fields with custom fields** or change post content to a `textarea` field. You can do that with the following steps:

- Remove the `post_fields` attribute from the shortcode
- Add post fields as normal custom fields to your meta box settings, like this:

```php
$meta_boxes[] = [
    'title'  => 'Bill Submit',
    'id'     => 'bill',
    'fields' => [
        [
            'name' => 'Submission Date',
            'id'   => 'submission_date',
            'type' => 'date',
        ],
        [
            'name' => 'Title',
            // highlight-next-line
            'id'   => 'post_title',
        ],
        [
            'name'    => 'Type',
            'id'      => 'type',
            'type'    => 'select',
            'options' => [
                'docs'    => 'Document',
                'receipt' => 'Receipt',
            ],
        ],
        [
            'name' => 'Description',
            'type' => 'textarea',
            // highlight-next-line
            'id'   => 'post_content',
        ],
        [
            'name' => 'Thumbnail',
            'type' => 'single_image',
            // highlight-next-line
            'id'   => '_thumbnail_id',
        ],
    ],
]
```

To make the plugin recognize the post fields, you need to set correct IDs for them as follows:

Field|ID
---|---
Post title|`post_title`
Post content|`post_content`
Post excerpt|`post_excerpt`
Post date|`post_date`
Post thumbnail|`_thumbnail_id`

With this method, you're able to set the label for post fields or change settings (even field type) for them easily using any [field settings](/field-settings/).

### Validation

There are 2 ways to validate fields: on the front end with JavaScript and on the back end with PHP.

For front-end validation with JavaScript, please see [this documentation](/validation/).

To validate on the back end with PHP, please use the `rwmb_frontend_validate` filter as follows:

```php
add_filter( 'rwmb_frontend_validate', function( $validate, $config ) {
    // Check only if you're on the right form.
    if ( 'your-meta-box-id' !== $config['id'] ) {
        return $validate;
    }
    // Check if users have selected files for an image upload field.
    if ( empty( $_POST['image_upload_field'] ) ) {
        $validate = false; // Return false to show an error message.
    }
    return $validate;
}, 10, 2 );
```

If you want to show a custom error message, return a string for the filter, like this:


```php
add_filter( 'rwmb_frontend_validate', function( $validate, $config ) {
    if ( 'your-meta-box-id' !== $config['id'] ) {
        return $validate;
    }
    if ( empty( $_POST['image_upload_field'] ) ) {
        $validate = 'Please select at least one image to upload'; // Return a custom error message
    }
    return $validate;
}, 10, 2 );
```

### File upload

#### User capability

To be able to upload files or images with the media popup (via fields `file_advanced`, `file_upload`, `image_advanced`, `image_upload`), users have to log in and proper capability `upload_files` to access the Media Library. If your users don't have that capability (like if they have the "subscriber" role), then the upload fields don't work. In that case, you can add the capability for that role as follows:

```php
add_action( 'init', function () {
    $subscriber = get_role( 'subscriber' );
    $subscriber->add_cap( 'upload_files' );
} );
```

Another solution is using `file` or `image` fields. Both of them work similarly. They just don't have a nice UI, but they do the job very well.

#### Post thumbnail

Another improvement you might want to add is to use the media popup to pick an image as the post thumbnail. By default, it uses the `image` field, which provides a simple input for an image.

To do that, you need to change the field type for the thumbnail from `image` to `single_image`. Here are the steps:

- Create a folder `mb-frontend-submission` in your theme, inside that folder, create a sub-folder `post`.
- Copy the file `thumbnail.php` from the plugin's `templates/post` folder to the `post` folder above.
- Replace the content of the copied `thumbnail.php` with [this code](https://pastebin.com/6AFcPF7b).

Please note that to open the media popup, users need to log in and have the proper capability. See the section above for how to do that.

### Embedding forms

If you have a front-end submission form on site A, then you want to output it on site B by embedding the form within an iframe, there might be a problem with the cookie policy on browsers that prevent it from submitting.

To make it work please add this snippet to `functions.php` in your theme on site A:

```php
add_action( 'template_redirect', function () {
    if ( session_status() !== PHP_SESSION_NONE || headers_sent() ) {
        return;
    }

    $params = session_get_cookie_params();
    session_set_cookie_params( $params['lifetime'], '/; samesite=None', $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'], true, false );
    session_start();
}, 9 );
```

The snippet above will set the cookie setting `samesite=None` and `Security=true`. Note that you can only use it on sites that use HTTPS (connection security) and on Chrome and Firefox. It doesn't work on Safari because Safari is blocking third-party cookies. Setting `samesite=None` also might be a security issue, so please be sure you want to do that. For more details, please [see this article](https://web.dev/samesite-cookies-explained/).

## User dashboard

Similar to the submission form, MB Frontend Submission provides a Gutenberg block for you to insert into a page. The block let users view and edit their submitted posts.

To insert a block, select the **User dashboard** block from the block inserter:

![User dashboard block](https://i.imgur.com/didLg44.png)

If you prefer to use shortcodes, use the following shortcode:

```php
[mb_frontend_dashboard edit_page="124"]
```

Below is the list of the settings. The attribute is used for the shortcode.

Name|Attribute|Description
---|---|--
Edit page|`edit_page`|The ID of the page, where users can submit posts.
Field group ID(s)|`id`|Overwrite field group ID(s) from the edit page. If multiple field groups, enter their IDs separated by commas.
Object type|`object_type`|The object type for the submitted data. Can be either `post` or `model`. Default is `post`.
Model name|`model_name`|The model name for the submitted data. Required if `object_type` is `model`.
Post type|`post_type`|Overwrite the submitted post type from the edit page.
Show welcome message|`show_welcome_message`|Show the welcome message `true` (default) or `false`.
Columns|`columns`|List of columns to be displayed in the dashboard, separated by commas. For example: `title`, `date`, and `status`...
Title column label|`label_title`|The label for the title column.
Date column label|`label_date`|The label for the date column.
Status column label|`label_status`|The label for the status column.
Actions column label|`label_actions`|The label for the actions column.
Post Action Link|`title_link`|The link action when clicking post titles: `edit` or `view` (default).
Add new button text|`add_new`|The add new button text.

:::caution

You **must** create a page for submitting posts first, then use its ID in the `edit_page` attribute.

:::

When users visit this page, they'll see a dashboard like this:

![user posts dashboard](https://i.imgur.com/LxPh4xH.png)

On this dashboard, users can:

- View a list of their submitted posts with the corresponding statuses
- Edit or delete submitted posts
- Or submit a new post

The plugin is smart enough to detect the correct settings from the submission form to the correct posts. So you can have *multiple* submission forms and multiple dashboards on the same website.

<FAQ question="How to manually set edit page attributes?">

By default, the plugin **implicitly** gets the attributes for the submission form from the edit page. That's why you must set the edit page in the block, shortcode or page builder elements.

However, there are cases you want to **explicitly** set these attributes, you can do so by setting the **Field group ID(s)** or the **Post type** attributes from the block, shortcode or page builder elements settings. These values will overwrite the values in the edit page.

You can also set these attributes with a filter like this:

```php
add_filter( 'rwmb_frontend_dashboard_edit_page_atts', function( $attributes, $edit_page_id ) {
    $attributes['post_type'] = 'book';
    return $attributes;
}, 10, 2 );
```

Note that the plugin only needs the field group ID(s) (`id`) and/or post type (`post_type`) attributes.
</FAQ>

## Integrations

MB Frontend Submission has integrations with **the block editor** (Gutenberg) and the following page builder plugins:

- Bricks
- Elementor

![Adding submission form and user dashboard in Bricks and Elementor](https://i.imgur.com/oH7RBcv.png)

For these page builders, there is a new section named Meta Box when you add an element. There’ll be two new elements in this section, one is **Submission Form** and another is **User Dashboard**. They work the same way as in the corresponding blocks in Gutenberg with the live preview on the page and visually settings.

## Hooks

To allow developers to do other things when the form is submitted, we have created some actions and filters.

### General hooks

`rwmb_frontend_redirect`

This filter allows you to change the URL of the redirect page after the form is submitted. It accepts 1 parameter `$config` - the shortcode attributes.

```php
$redirect = apply_filters( 'rwmb_frontend_redirect', $redirect, $config );
```

Note that `$config['post_id']` has the submitted post ID.

Example: redirect to a page based on a submitted value:

```php
add_filter( 'rwmb_frontend_redirect', function( $redirect, $config ) {
    // Make sure you work on the correct form.
    if ( 'my-id' !== $config['id'] ) {
        return $redirect;
    }

    // Get submitted data via $_POST.
    $value = empty( $_POST['field_id'] ) ? null : $_POST['field_id'];
    if ( 'yes' === $value ) {
        $redirect = 'https://yourdomain.com/custom-page/';
    }
    return $redirect;
}, 10, 2 );
```

`rwmb_frontend_validate`

This filter is used to check if the form is validated. You can use this filter to add a custom check for the data before it's processed.

```php
apply_filters( 'rwmb_frontend_validate', $validate, $config );
```

The filter has 2 parameters:

- `$validate`: the returned value of validation. If `true`, then the validation is successful. `false` - if not and the plugin will show a default error message. If you want to show a custom error message, just return it as a string. See the **Validation** section above.
- `$config`: the form configuration.

### Form hooks

`rwmb_frontend_before_process`

This action fires before the form is processed, e.g. saved or updated. It accepts one parameter `$config` - the form configuration, taken from the shortcode attributes.

`rwmb_frontend_after_process`

This action fires after the form is processed, e.g. saved or updated. It accepts 2 parameters:

- `$config` - the form configuration, taken from the shortcode attributes.
- `$post_id` - the submitted post ID

You can use this action to do a custom redirect to your Thank you page or send an email notification.

```php
add_action( 'rwmb_frontend_after_process', function( $config, $post_id ) {
    if ( 'my-meta-box' === $config['id'] ) {
        wp_mail( 'admin@domain.com', 'New submission', 'A new post has been just submitted.' );

        wp_safe_redirect( 'thank-you' );
        die;
    }
}, 10, 2 );
```

`rwmb_frontend_before_form`

This action fires before form output. It accepts one parameter `$config` - the form configuration, taken from the shortcode attributes.

`rwmb_frontend_after_form`

This action fires after form output. It accepts one parameter `$config` - the form configuration, taken from the shortcode attributes.

`rwmb_frontend_before_display_confirmation`

This action fires before the confirmation message is displayed. It accepts one parameter `$config` - the form configuration, taken from the shortcode attributes.

`rwmb_frontend_after_display_confirmation`

This action fires after the confirmation message is displayed. It accepts one parameter `$config` - the form configuration, taken from the shortcode attributes.

`rwmb_frontend_before_submit_button`

This action fires before the submit button is displayed. It accepts one parameter `$config` - the form configuration, taken from the shortcode attributes.

`rwmb_frontend_submit_button`

This filter allows you to change the submit button HTML. It accepts 2 parameters:
- `$submit_button` - the submit button HTML.
- `$post_id` - the post ID

`rwmb_frontend_after_submit_button`

This action fires after the submit button is displayed. It accepts one parameter `$config` - the form configuration, taken from the shortcode attributes.

`rwmb_frontend_before_delete`

This action fires before the post is deleted. It accepts one parameter `$config` - the form configuration, taken from the shortcode attributes.

`rwmb_frontend_after_delete`

This action fires after the post is deleted. It accepts 2 parameters:

- `$config` - the form configuration, taken from the shortcode attributes.
- `$post_id` - the deleted post ID

### Post data filters

`rwmb_frontend_insert_post_data`

This filter is used to modify the submitted post data before it's passed to the `wp_insert_post` function to **create a new post**. It accepts 2 parameters: the array of post data and the shortcode parameters.

```php
$data = apply_filters( 'rwmb_frontend_insert_post_data', $data, $config );
```

`rwmb_frontend_update_post_data`

This filter is used to modify the submitted post data before it's passed to the `wp_update_post` function to **update an existing post**. It accepts 2 parameters: the array of post data and the shortcode parameters.

```php
$data = apply_filters( 'rwmb_frontend_update_post_data', $data, $config );
```

### Post field filters

Sometimes you want to add more things to the post fields, such as making the post title required, adding a description for post content, or even adding a custom HTML before the post thumbnail. You can do that with the following post filter:

```php
// Post title
$field = apply_filters( 'rwmb_frontend_post_title', [
    'type' => 'text',
    'name' => 'Title',
    'id'   => 'post_title',
] );

// Post thumbnail
$field = apply_filters( 'rwmb_frontend_post_thumbnail', [
    'type'             => 'image',
    'name'             => 'Thumbnail',
    'id'               => '_thumbnail_id',
    'max_file_uploads' => 1,
] );

// Post excerpt
$field   = apply_filters( 'rwmb_frontend_post_excerpt', [
    'type' => 'textarea',
    'name' => 'Excerpt',
    'id'   => 'post_excerpt',
] );

// Post date
$field = apply_filters( 'rwmb_frontend_post_date', [
    'type' => 'datetime',
    'name' => 'Date',
    'id'   => 'post_date',
] );

// Post content
$field   = apply_filters( 'rwmb_frontend_post_content', [
    'type' => 'wysiwyg',
    'name' => 'Content',
    'id'   => 'post_content',
] );
```

Each post field is treated as a normal Meta Box field (see here for the full list of [field settings](/field-settings/)).

So, to make the post title required, you can do like this:

```php
add_filter( 'rwmb_frontend_post_title', function( $field ) {
    $field['required'] = true;
    return $field;
} );
```

### Post actions

`rwmb_frontend_before_save_post`

This action fires before the post is created or updated.

```
do_action( 'rwmb_frontend_before_save_post', $object );
```

The action accepts 1 parameter: the instance of the `\MBFS\Post` class, which handles the submission. It has the following public properties that you can use:

- `$post_type`: The current post type
- `$post_id`: The submitted post ID
- `$fields`: The post fields
- `$config`: The configuration, taken from the shortcode attributes

`rwmb_frontend_after_save_post`

This action fires after the post is created or updated. At that time, all the custom fields in the meta box are already saved into the post meta.

```
do_action( 'rwmb_frontend_after_save_post', $object );
```

The action accepts 1 parameter: the instance of the `\MBFS\Post` class, which handles the submission. It has the following public properties that you can use:

- `$post_type`: The current post type
- `$post_id`: The submitted post ID
- `$fields`: The post fields
- `$config`: The configuration, taken from the shortcode attributes

### Dashboard

`rwmb_frontend_dashboard_edit_page_atts`

This filter allows you to explicitly set the attributes for the edit page. See **User Dashboard** section above.

```php
add_filter( 'rwmb_frontend_dashboard_edit_page_atts', function( $attributes, $edit_page_id ) {
    $attributes['post_type'] = 'book';
    return $attributes;
}, 10, 2 );
```

`rwmb_frontend_dashboard_query_args`

This filter is used for changing the query args for getting posts on the dashboard page. By default, the plugin will get posts that have the same author as the current user. If you want to change this query, then use this filter.

```php
add_filter( 'rwmb_frontend_dashboard_query_args', function( $args ) {
    $args['cat'] = 1; // Get only posts in category ID = 1.

    return $args;
} );
```

`rwmb_frontend_welcome_message`

This filter is used to change the welcome message. It accepts 3 parameters:

- `$message`: the message content (in HTML)
- `$user`: the current user
- `$query`: the post query

`rwmb_frontend_dashboard_edit_page_content`

This filter is used to change the edited page content. The edit page content is used for parsing the edit form configuration. It accepts only one parameter - the content in HTML.

`rwmb_frontend_dashboard_post_title`

This filter is used to change the title link of posts in the post table. It accepts 2 parameters:

- `$title`: the post title link (in HTML)
- `$post_id`: the post ID

`rwmb_frontend_dashboard_edit_action`

This filter is used to change the edit link for posts in the dashboard. It has 2 parameters: the edit link HTML and the post ID.

```php
add_filter( 'rwmb_frontend_dashboard_edit_action', function( $edit_action, $post_id ) {
    $svg_icon = get_template_directory_uri() . 'icons/edit.svg';
    return '<a href="' . add_query_arg( 'rwmb_frontend_field_post_id', $post_id, 'https://domain.com/submit-page' ) . '><img src="' . $svg_icon . '""></a>';
}, 10, 2 );
```

`rwmb_frontend_dashboard_delete_action`

This filter is used to change the delete button for posts in the dashboard. It has 2 parameters: the delete button HTML and the post ID.

`rwmb_frontend_before_edit_action`

This action fires before the edit button is displayed.

`rwmb_frontend_before_delete_action`

This action fires before the delete button is displayed.

`rwmb_frontend_end_actions`

This action fires after all action buttons are displayed.

`[mb_frontend_form id="meta-box-id-1,posts-to-page_relationships_from" post_fields="title,content"]`

</FAQ>

## Known issues

### Styling

The extension outputs the default fields' HTML with CSS comes from the Meta Box plugin. The style is basic and works in most cases. However, to make it match perfectly with your theme's style, you need to do some work with CSS.

### Caching

As you might know, Meta Box uses [nonces](https://developer.wordpress.org/apis/security/nonces/) to prevent misuse or malicious requests. As the nonce fields are outputted directly in the HTML, they might be cached by caching plugins such as W3 Total Cache, WP Super Cache, etc. And thus, the verification of the nonce might not work properly and break the form submission. In this case, please do not cache the page where the form is embedded (both caching plugins allow you to do that).
