### Default fields

By default, the user profile form doesn't include any default user fields, such as first name, last name or biography. To be able to edit these fields, please [create a field group for users](/extensions/mb-user-meta/) with those fields, keeping the same field IDs as WordPress's.

For example, the code below creates a meta box for editing user first name, last name and biography:

```php
add_filter( 'rwmb_meta_boxes', function( $meta_boxes ) {
    $meta_boxes[] = [
        'title'  => 'Default Fields',
        'id'     => 'default-fields',
        'type'   => 'user', // NOTICE THIS
        'fields' => [
            [
                // highlight-next-line
                'id'   => 'first_name',
                'name' => 'First Name',
                'type' => 'text',
            ],
            [
                // highlight-next-line
                'id'   => 'last_name',
                'name' => 'Last Name',
                'type' => 'text',
            ],
            [
                // highlight-next-line
                'id'   => 'description',
                'name' => 'Biography',
                'type' => 'textarea',
            ],
        ],
    ];
    return $meta_boxes;
} );
```

And use it in the user edit profile form with this shortcode:

```php
[mb_user_profile_info id="default-fields"]
```

In order to make the plugin recognize the user fields, you need to set correct ID for them. See the table below:

Field|ID
---|---
User email|`user_email`
User nicename|`user_nicename`
User URL|`user_url`
Display name|`display_name`
First name|`first_name`
Last name|`last_name`
Registration date|`user_registered`
Biography|`description`
Rich editing|`rich_editing`
Syntax highlighting|`syntax_highlighting`
Admin color|`admin_color`
Comment shortcuts|`comment_shortcuts`
Show admin bar on the front|`admin_bar_front`
User role|`role`

:::caution

These default fields do not work as sub-fields in a group.

### User password

To let users change their password, please use the field group ID `rwmb-user-info` in the shortcode as below:

```php
[mb_user_profile_info id="rwmb-user-info"]
```

## Force password change

MB User Profile allows you set a security rule that forces users to change their password after the first login. To enable this feature, go to **Settings > General** and tick the checkbox **Force password change**:

![Force password change settings](https://i.imgur.com/z82eSRB.png)

After that, any users registered with MB User Profile will be requested to change their password when they login to the website the first time.

## Email templates

MB User Profile send emails to users when:

- They reset their passwords
- They register and are requested to confirm by email

To overwrite the emails created by the plugin, please:

- Create a folder `mb-user-profile` in your theme (or your child theme)
- Copy the email templates from the MB User Profile's `templates` folder to the `mb-user-profile` folder that you've just created above
- Edit the new templates files

Now the emails sent by the plugin will use the templates in your theme.

## Known issues

### Upload files / images

To be able to upload files or images (via fields `file_advanced`, `file_upload`, `image_advanced`, `image_upload`), users have to login and proper capability `upload_files` to access the Media Library. If your users don't have that capability (if they have subscriber role), then the upload fields don't work. In that case, you can add the capability for that role as follows:

```php
add_action( 'init', function () {
    // Replace 'subscriber' with the required role to update.
    $subscriber = get_role( 'subscriber' );
    $subscriber->add_cap( 'upload_files' );
} );
```

Another solution is using `file` or `image` fields. Both of them works similar. They just don't have a nice UI, but they do the job very well.

### Styling

The extension outputs the default fields' HTML with CSS comes from Meta Box plugin. The style is basic and works in most cases. However, to make it match perfectly with your theme's style, you need to do some work with CSS.

### Caching

As you might know, Meta Box uses [nonces](https://developer.wordpress.org/apis/security/nonces/) to prevent misuse or malicious requests. As the nonce fields are outputted directly in the HTML, they might be cached by caching plugins such as W3 Total Cache, WP Super Cache, etc. And thus, the verification of the nonce might not work properly and break the form submission. In this case, please do not cache the page where the form is embeded (caching plugins allow you to do that).
