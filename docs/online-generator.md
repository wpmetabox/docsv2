## Conclusion

**Online Generator** is a great tool for WordPress beginners and developers to generate custom meta boxes and custom fields for the [Meta Box plugin](https://metabox.io/). It saves you a lot of time with a friendly UI and lets you build a bunch of fields without touching code.

It works as a stand-alone tool, meaning that it can't be put inside your WordPress admin. Instead, you can copy the generated code and paste it into your theme's functions.php file.

In the case that you want to use it inside your WordPress admin and have extra settings for fields or [premium extensions](https://metabox.io/plugins/), don’t forget to try [MB Builder](https://docs.metabox.io/extensions/meta-box-builder/).

Beside using the generator for the custom fields, you may want to have custom post types and custom taxonomies. So, **Meta Box** also provides several WordPress generator tools such as [WordPress Custom Post Type Generator](https://metabox.io/post-type-generator/), and [WordPress Custom Taxonomy Generator](https://metabox.io/taxonomy-generator/). Or. you can use the [MB Custom Post Type plugin](https://metabox.io/plugins/custom-post-type/) to create custom post type and custom taxonomy inside your website. It is free and available on [wordpress.org](https://wordpress.org/plugins/mb-custom-post-type/).
