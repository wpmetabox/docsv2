title: Status Column
---

The status column lets you quickly switch the status of field groups, custom post types, custom taxonomies, settings pages, and relationships between Publish and Draft without opening each item individually. You can enable this feature for posts of a custom post type as well.

This feature adds a small toggle button directly to the management screen. Simply switch it **on** to publish, or **off** to save as a draft.

As a result, the traditional **Publish**/**Update** actions on the edit screens of field groups, custom post types, custom taxonomies, settings pages, and relationships are replaced with a single **Save Changes** button.

## Status column for posts of custom post type

To add status column into the table of the post list of a custom post type, when you creating that post type, navigate to the **Features** tab, then enable the setting as below:

Then, you’ll see the Status column displayed. Just turn the button on to publish or turn it off to save the post to a draft.
