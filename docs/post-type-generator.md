[Post Type Generator](https://metabox.io/post-type-generator/) is a free online tool to help you create and set up custom post types easily with a simple and intuitive user interface. With this tool, you can copy and paste PHP code for custom post types in a few clicks.

One notable feature of this tool is that it can be used independently from Meta Box. Therefore, you don’t need to install the Meta Box to use Post Type Generator.


## Set up a New Custom Post Type

### Set up General Options

After opening this tool [here](https://metabox.io/post-type-generator/), fill in the basic information for your new custom post type like **Plural name, Singular name** and **Slug** in the **General** tab. The **Function name** and **Text domain** already have default values, but you can change them as well.

Pay attention to some fields:

- **Publicly queryable?** If you tick the box, it can query to take the data of your post type so that the content of it can be displayed on the front end.
- Similarly, put a tick to the **Show UI?** and **Show in nav menus?** if you want to show your post type UI and show your post type in nav menus in the Dashboard. It’s recommended to enable them for easy management.
- **Hierarchical?** If you want your post type to have a parent post type and sub post type in order to sort and manage it conveniently, enable this.
