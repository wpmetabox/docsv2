import File from '../_parts/_file.md';

The file advanced field uses the WordPress media popup for selecting / uploading files. You can also reorder files if you want.

## Settings

Besides the [common settings](/field-settings/), this field has the following specific settings, the keys are for use with code:

Name | Key | Description
--- | --- | ---
Max number of files | `max_file_uploads` | Max number of uploaded files. Optional.
Force delete | `force_delete` | Whether or not delete the files from Media Library when deleting them from post meta. `true` or `false` (default). Optional. Note: it might affect other posts if you use the same file for multiple posts.
MIME types | `mime_type` | The MIME type of files which you want to show in the Media Library. Note: this is a filter for items in the media popup, it doesn't restrict file types when uploading. See [common MIME types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types/Common_types).
Show status | `max_status` | Display how many files uploaded/remaining. Applied only when "Max number of files" is defined. `true` (default) or `false`. Optional.

This is a sample field settings array when creating this field with code:

```php
[
    'id'               => 'file',
    'name'             => 'File Advanced',
    'type'             => 'file_advanced',
    'force_delete'     => false,
    'max_file_uploads' => 2,
    'mime_type'        => 'application/pdf',
    'max_status'       => false,
],
```

## Data

This field saves multiple attachment IDs in the database. Each value (attachment ID) is stored in a single row in the database with the same meta key (similar to what `add_post_meta` does with the last parameter `false`).

## Template usage

<File />

## Filters

This field has some filters to change the texts displayed on the screen..

Filter|Default|Description
---|---|---
`rwmb_media_add_string`|+ Add Media|Add new file string
`rwmb_media_single_files_string`|file|Singular "file" string
`rwmb_media_multiple_files_string`|files|Plural "files" string
`rwmb_media_remove_string`|Remove|File remove string
`rwmb_media_edit_string`|Edit|File edit string
`rwmb_media_view_string`|View|File view string

The code below changes the "+ Add Media" string:

```php
add_filter( 'rwmb_media_add_string', function () {
    return '+ New File';
} );
```
