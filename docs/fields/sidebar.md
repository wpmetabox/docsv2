The sidebar field allows you to select one or multiple sidebars. This field has several settings that can be displayed as a: simple select dropdown, checkbox list, or beautiful select dropdown with select2 library.

## Settings

Besides the [common settings](/field-settings/), this field has the following specific settings, the keys are for use with code:

Name | Key | Description
--- | --- | ---
Placeholder | `placeholder` | The placeholder for the select box. The default is "Select a sidebar". Applied only when the field type is a select field.
Field type | `field_type` | How the sidebars are displayed? See below.

This field inherits the look and field (and settings) from other fields, depending on the field type, which accepts the following value:

Field type | Description | Settings inherited from
--- | --- | ---
`select` | Simple select dropdown. | [Select](/fields/select/)
`select_advanced` | Beautiful select dropdown using the select2 library. This is the default value. | [Select advanced](/fields/select-advanced/)
`checkbox_list` | Flatten list of checkboxes which allows to select multiple items. | [Checkbox list](/fields/checkbox-list/)
`radio_list` | Flatten list of radio boxes which allows to select only 1 item. | [Radio](/fields/radio/)

This is a sample field settings array when creating this field with code:

```php
[
    'name'        => 'Sidebar',
    'id'          => 'sidebar',
    'type'        => 'sidebar',
    'field_type'  => 'select_advanced',
    'placeholder' => 'Select a sidebar',
],
```

## Data

This field saves sidebar ID(s) in the database.

If "Multiple" is not set, a single sidebar ID is saved in the database. Otherwise, the field saves multiple sidebar IDs in the database, where each sidebar ID is stored in a single row in the database with the same meta key (similar to what `add_post_meta` does with the last parameter `false`).

If the field is cloneable, then the value is stored as a serialized array in a single row in the database.

## Template usage

**Display widgets for the selected sidebar:**

```php
<div class="sidebar">
    <?php rwmb_the_value( 'my_field_id' ) ?>
</div>
```

**Checking if the selected sidebar has widgets and displaying it:**

```php
<?php
$sidebar_id = rwmb_meta( 'my_field_id' );
if ( is_active_sidebar( $sidebar_id ) ) {
    dynamic_sidebar( $sidebar_id );
}
```
