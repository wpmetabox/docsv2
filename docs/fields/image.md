The image field creates a simple image upload with default UI like `<input type="file">`. Unlike other media fields, this field doesn't use Media Library UI to upload images.

This field is very similar to [file](/fields/file/). The only difference is that the file field allows uploading all file types while this field allows only images.

## Screenshots

<Screenshots

    ]}
/>

## Settings

Besides the [common settings](/field-settings/), this field has the following specific settings, the keys are for use with code:

Name | Key | Description
--- | --- | ---
Max number of files | `max_file_uploads` | Max number of uploaded files. Optional.
Force delete | `force_delete` | Whether or not delete the files from Media Library when deleting them from post meta. `true` or `false` (default). Optional. Note: it might affect other posts if you use the same file for multiple posts.
Custom upload folder | `upload_dir` | Full path to a custom upload folder.
Unique filename callback | `unique_filename_callback` | Custom callback to set the uploaded file name. Works only when uploading to a custom folder.

This is a sample field settings array when creating this field with code:

```php
[
    'name'         => 'Image Upload',
    'id'           => 'field_id',
    'type'         => 'image',
    'force_delete' => false,
],
```

## Data

This field saves multiple attachment IDs in the database. Each value (attachment ID) is stored in a single row in the database with the same meta key (similar to what `add_post_meta` does with the last parameter `false`).

## Custom upload folder

<CustomUploadFolder />

## Template usage

<Image />

## Filters

This field has some filters to change the texts displayed on the screen.

Filter|Default|Description
---|---|---
`rwmb_file_upload_string`|Upload Files|File upload string
`rwmb_file_add_string`|+ Add new file|Add new file string
`rwmb_file_delete_string`|Delete|File delete string
`rwmb_file_edit_string`|Edit|File edit string

All filters above accept 2 parameters:

- `$string`: the string needs to be changed
- `$field`: array of the field settings

The code below changes the "+ Add new file" string:

```php
add_filter( 'rwmb_file_add_string', function () {
    return '+ New File';
} );
```
