title: Custom HTML

import Screenshots from '@site/src/components/Screenshots';

The custom HTML field allows you to output anything. You can even use a PHP callback function to output the HTML.

This field is usually used to display custom messages/instructions to users. Sometimes, it's used with PHP callback to display more advanced content (such as content from a query).

<Screenshots name="custom-html" col1={[

## Settings

Besides the [common settings](/field-settings/), this field has the following specific settings, the keys are for use with code:

Name | Key | Description
--- | --- | ---
Content | `std` | The custom HTML content.
PHP Callback | `callback` | The PHP function that returns the custom HTML content. Optional.

This is a sample field settings array for registering this field with code:

```php
[
    'type' => 'custom_html',
    'std'  => '<div class="alert alert-warning">This is a custom HTML content</div>',
],
```


## Styling

Because this field is usually used to display custom content, it requires some CSS to make the content looks good. To enqueue a CSS file to the admin editing page, use the [rwmb_enqueue_scripts](/actions/rwmb-enqueue-scripts/) hook:

```php
add_action( 'rwmb_enqueue_scripts', function () {
    wp_enqueue_style( 'style-id', get_template_directory_uri() . '/css/admin.css' );
} );
```

And in the `admin.css` you can put your custom styles.
