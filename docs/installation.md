## Requirements

To run Meta Box, we recommend:
- PHP 7.4 or greater
- Latest version of WordPress

While Meta Box also works with PHP 7.0 and older versions of WordPress, these versions have reached the official End Of Life and as such may expose your site to security vulnerabilities.

## Installing Meta Box

Meta Box offers [three different versions](/introduction/#meta-box-overview), each with slightly different installation steps.

We recommend using [**Meta Box Lite**](https://metabox.io/lite/), a free version with essential features and a user-friendly interface.

Here's how to install it:

1. Go to [our website](https://metabox.io/lite/), just fill in your email, and download it.
2. Go to **Plugins** > **Add New Plugin** > **Upload Plugin**.
3. Upload the downloaded file and click **Install Now**.
