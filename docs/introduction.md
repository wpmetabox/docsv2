## What is Meta Box?

When using WordPress as a CMS (not just for blogging), you'll need more than just posts and pages. For example, if you want to show events on your website, you'll need a content type called "event" with some fields to store event details such as date and location. In WordPress, we call them [custom post type](/custom-post-types/) and [custom field](/custom-fields/). To create custom post types and custom fields, you'll need a plugin like Meta Box.

Meta Box is a framework that helps you create custom post types and custom fields quickly and easily. A framework provides all the tools you need for managing data and building features for your WordPress websites, saving you time and allowing you to focus on business logic.

Meta Box provides powerful features [via extensions](/extensions/) such as front-end form submission, creating post relationships, saving data in custom tables, toggling fields with conditional logic, creating Gutenberg blocks, and many integrations with 3rd-party plugins.

Whether you are a WordPress user or developer, Meta Box is a toolkit that can grow with you. We'll help you to boost your productivity and workflow. We can't wait to see what you build.

## Why Meta Box?

There are a variety of plugins available to you when working with custom fields. However, we believe Meta Box is the best choice for building a performant and full-featured website.

**Easy for everyone**

With a user-friendly interface, low-code features, and built-in snippets, you can work with Meta Box easily even if you are not a developer.

**Full-featured**

Meta Box offers the most complete set of features among custom fields plugins. Whatever you need, Meta Box has it for you. The more you use, the more you will find.

**Lightweight & fast**

Being thoroughly optimized for code and for how to store data, Meta Box never impacts your website speed or performance.

**Extensibility**

With APIs and actions, filters in many necessary places, you can change how to display fields, change data, or do other things like sending emails.

## Meta Box overview

Meta Box has 3 versions:

* **Meta Box**: the foundation and framework of all [extensions](https://docs.metabox.io/extensions/) and features. Then, you can add individual extensions (free or premium) to have advanced features. It doesn't have any UI, and is suitable for developers only, who need to use code to use it.
* [**Meta Box Lite**](https://metabox.io/lite/): a single free UI version of Meta Box that includes the Meta Box plugin, [MB Builder](/extensions/meta-box-builder/), and all the free extensions to create custom post types, custom taxonomies, custom fields, relationships.
* [**Meta Box AIO**](https://metabox.io/aio/): a single premium plugin that includes the Meta Box plugin and all the extensions (both free and premium ones). Meta Box AIO allows you to install only one plugin and have everything from Meta Box, so you can have the plugin list short and clean.

In short, if you're a free user, just use Meta Box Lite. For paid users, just use Meta Box AIO!
