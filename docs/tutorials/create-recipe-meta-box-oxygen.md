import LiteYouTubeEmbed from 'react-lite-youtube-embed';

We’ll use Oxygen to build a singular page and get the recipe information stored in the custom fields created with Meta Box.

## Preparation

All of the information about the recipe will be saved in posts of a **custom post type**. The recipe’s name and the dish picture are the title and the featured image of the post. Besides, the remaining detailed information will be saved in **custom fields**.

So, we need [Meta Box Lite](https://metabox.io/lite/) in this practice to create custom post type and have UI for creating custom field.

And, [Oxygen](https://oxygenbuilder.com/) to build the page. You should use the 3.9 version or higher which has the integration with Meta Box already.

## 1. Creating a custom post type

Use the quick action in the dashboard or go to **Meta Box > Post Types > Add New**.

Then, enter information and configure the post type.

## 2. Creating custom fields

Move to **Meta Box > Custom Fields**, then create fields as you want.

Here are the fields I use for this practice:

Pay attention to the video information. Normally, we use the **URL** field to save links, but if you use it, Oxygen will display the link in text format only. Then, we must take a few more steps to convert the link into the video preview.

However, Meta Box has the **oEmbed** fields that allow you to save the link and display it as the video preview on the frontend directly. So, we’ll use it for more convenience.

Next, move to the **Settings** tab > **Location** > choose **Post Type** as **Recipes** to apply these fields to this post type.

In the post editor, you will see all of the newly created custom fields.

## 3. Creating a template with Oxygen

Go to the **Oxygen** menu and create a new template.

In the settings of the template, select a design that you want the template to inherit from, then choose your post type in the **Singular** section to apply the template to it.

Now, go to edit any post, we can see the template is already rendered for this product page.

After filling in the information for the recipe, let’s edit the template with Oxygen.

First, select a **Section** component to cover all of the recipe information.

![Select a Section](https://imgur.elightup.com/Dx2dg0D.png)

To get the recipe’s name, which is the title of the post, add a **Heading** component. Then, connect it to the post title to get data.

![Add a Heading component and connect it to the post title to get data.](https://imgur.elightup.com/Fn0YwT4.gif)

In the first section, I’ll divide the content into two columns like this:

![Divide the content into 2 columns](https://imgur.elightup.com/Dm1ogHm.png)

So, add a **Column** component. Then, there’ll be two **div** tags available inside it, equivalent to two columns. In the first div tag, add the **Featured Image** component to get the dish’s image.

![Add an extra div inside as for the row](https://imgur.elightup.com/YZpgSjH.png)

Move to the second column, which covers all the information about the completed time. I’ll add an extra div inside it. This div is for a row.

![Add a Text component, and connect it to the field that saves the corresponding time information](https://imgur.elightup.com/c6uJEsA.png)

Inside this div, add a Text component and connect it to the field that saves the corresponding time information. Then, choose the Heading component and name it. Finally, style the row in your own way.

![Duplicate the div and change the name and fields](https://imgur.elightup.com/XGYqe77.png)

Then, you can duplicate the div that is used for the first row to have more rows. Then, change the names and fields.

For the rest section, we create another **div** in the **Section** component. Inside this div, choose the **Heading** component and name it, e.g. Ingredients. Also, add the **Text** component, then connect it to the corresponding field which saves the information about the ingredients, instructions, note, nutrition, equipment.

![Create another div in the section](https://imgur.elightup.com/D1099pU.png)

For the video information, there is a difference. Replace the **Text** component by the **Video**.

To display that data, I'll add a **Video** component. Then, just change the link by inserting the dynamic data from the **oEmbed** field that we use to save the video’s link.

We’ve finished getting all of the recipe information. On the frontend, you see that all of them are already displayed.

## 4. Styling the page

Back to the page editor with Oxygen, choose each component and change the settings to style them.

I’ll style the time section for example. This section has 4 row and they should be have the same style, so I’ll use a class for 4 rows. Style a row, then these 4 rows will change the style at once.

Go to the recipe page, and you’ll see the new look.
