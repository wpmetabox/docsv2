# Migrating custom fields data from ACF to Meta Box

You can easily move data from **ACF** to **Meta Box** with the help of the **MB ACF Migration** plugin. It will save a lot of time and shorten the process dramatically.

## Preparation

In addition to using the <a href="https://metabox.io/">Meta Box</a>, make sure you already have these extensions:

* <a href="https://metabox.io/plugins/meta-box-builder/">MB Builder</a>: A Meta Box premium extension that provides a UI to create and manage custom fields on the backend;
* <a href="https://metabox.io/plugins/mb-acf-migration/">MB ACF Migration</a>: This extension is also available in the WordPress repo. Besides, if you use Meta Box AIO or Meta Box Core (in the premium bundle), go to **Meta Box** &gt; **Extensions**, and you will see MB ACF Migration in the list. Just tick to enable it.

Besides these above plugins, remember to install all the Meta Box extensions that correspond to the migrated features. For example, if you have fields in a group created by ACF, you have to enable **Meta Box Group** to migrate the group field data. Or, in ACF, when you set a location to display a field group in taxonomy, you have to activate the **MB Term Meta** extension in Meta Box.

## 1. Checking and backing up the data

**Note**: Remember to back up your data before migrating to avoid unexpected errors.

I have these custom fields created by ACF for example, including **Text**, **Email**, **Gallery**, and **Repeater**. The **Repeater** has three sub-fields: **Checkbox**, **Text**, and **Gallery.**

Besides, I used conditional logic to display the image field when users choose the **Project Type** as Web Design. The field group that I created by ACF is shown like this:

Make sure that when you migrate custom fields data from ACF to Meta Box, you’ve activated all the necessary plugins, even ACF.

As you can see here in the **Plugin** menu, the ACF has already been activated.

## 2. Installing Meta Box extensions

As I said before, we need to install extensions that correspond to the features that you used with ACF.

In this case, similar to all the above features in **ACF**, I will use these extensions of Meta Box:

* **Meta Box Group**: to have a group field corresponding to Group + Repeater in ACF
* **MB Conditional Logic**: to have the conditional logic feature.

## 3. Migrating the data

Go to the **Meta Box** menu &gt; **ACF Migration** &gt; Click the **Migrate** button.

When the process finishes, it will show a “Done” message.


:::caution

The **AFC** menu will automatically disappear when the migration process finishes. This is because **Meta Box** turned the ACF plugin off automatically to avoid problems caused by registering the same post type.

## 4. Rechecking the data after migration

Now, you can see that the fields are displayed the same as when you use **ACF**. All the features, like group and conditional logic, also work well.

Here are the fields that are shown in the field edit. All the information, such as field group ID and ID of each field, has remained:

And the **ACF** has already been deactivated.

The migration has been done.
