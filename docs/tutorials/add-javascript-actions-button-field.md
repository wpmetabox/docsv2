In WordPress, there are only default functional buttons on the backend to do some actions like submitting posts or adding categories. Do you want to add other custom functional buttons to make your management much easier? Today, we’ll find a way to add custom JavaScript actions using the Button field with Meta Box in the most convenient way.

You can see it clearer with these two Button fields to remove or input values into multiple custom fields at once.

## Preparation

Here are the tools we need:
* [Meta Box core plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/meta-box/): to have a framework to create custom fields;
* [MB Builder](https://metabox.io/plugins/meta-box-builder/): to have a UI on the back end to easily create the fields.

## 1. Creating custom fields

I’m using WooCommerce so I have a custom post type as **Products** already. Now, just create some fields for it.

### 1.1. Creating custom fields to input data

I’ll create some typical fields. If you don’t know how to add custom fields for a WooCommerce website, you can [read this article](https://metabox.io/add-custom-fields-for-woocommerce/).

Remember the **ID** of these fields because you need to insert them to the code in the third step.

Then, go to the **Settings** tabs, set the **Location** as **Post type** and choose your post type to apply these fields to it. Here I chose **Product**.

Then, you will see the fields displayed on the post editor.

Normally, to input or remove data from these custom fields, you must click on one by one and do it manually. But with JavaScript, you can use another field to automatically do it in bulk. Let’s do it!

### 1.2. Creating custom buttons

Go to **Meta Box** > **Custom Fields** to create a new field group for the buttons.

Firstly, I’ll create a button to reset the value of all the created fields at once. It means removing the data that are saving in the fields.

Add a field in the type as **Button**.

Also remember the ID of this field.

Create another button to add default values for those fields at the same time as well.

After that, go to the **Settings** tab, set **Location** as the same post type that we applied the previous field group to.

Then, in the post editor of any product, you will see the custom fields and new buttons with the label you created.

But so far, these buttons haven’t worked.

Let’s move on to add JavaScript to handle custom actions for them.

## 2. Adding JavaScript to handle custom actions

We should add some code to the theme’s files or use some third-party plugins as Code Snippets to add code.

In the `functions.php` file, add this code to create a new JS file in the **js** folder.

```
add_action( 'rwmb_enqueue_scripts', function() {
    wp_enqueue_script( 'script-id', get_template_directory_uri() . '/js/admin.js', ['jquery'], '', true );
} );
```
The file is named as **`admin.js`**.

![add code to create a new JS file in the js folder in the functions.php file](https://i.imgur.com/5pQSbiN.png)

Go to the created file, and add the following code:

```
jQuery( function ( $ ) {
    $( '#button_reset' ).on( 'click', function() {
        $( '#product-information' ).find( 'input[type=text]' ).val('');
    } );

    $( '#set_default' ).on( 'click', function() {
        $( '#product-information' ).find( '#wholesale_price' ).val('150000');
        $( '#product-information' ).find( '#retail_price' ).val('100000');
        $( '#product-information' ).find( '#discount_price' ).val('80000');
    } );
} );
```

![Go to the created file, and add some code](https://i.imgur.com/KofTI05.png)

**Explanation**:

```
$( '#button_reset' ).on( 'click', function() {
```

This is to trigger the moment when users click on the **Reset** button (the ID of the button is `button_reset`).

If they do so, this code will run:

```
$( '#product-information' ).find( 'input[type=text]' ).val('');
```

It will set all the values of the custom fields in the field group with the ID **`product-information`** to blank. It means that all the values of the fields in this field group will be deleted at once.

```
$( '#set_default' ).on( 'click', function() {
```

This is to trigger the moment when users click on the Default button which has the ID as **`set_default`**.

When a user clicks on it, these lines of code will run to set values to the fields:

```
$( '#product-information' ).find( '#wholesale_price' ).val('150000');
$( '#product-information' ).find( '#retail_price' ).val('100000');
$( '#product-information' ).find( '#discount_price' ).val('80000');
```

In there, **`product-information`** is the ID of the field group that contains the custom fields we want to set the values. `wholesale_price`, `retail_price`, and `discount_price` are the IDs of each field that we want to set value for. `'150000'`, `'100000'`, and `'80000'` are the values that we will input to the fields.

If you want to change these default values, you can replace them with any value you want.

Now, go back to the post editor. You can click on these two buttons to see how they work.

They work nicely!
