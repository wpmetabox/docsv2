A testimonial includes 2 irreplaceable contents: user name and user reviews. However, to make testimonials more credible and trustworthy, you should also add positions and images of the reviewers, attach a link if available, etc.

This is an outstanding feature of MB Testimonials in comparison to other plugins. It helps you to immediately apply the built-in templates to testimonials without any adjustment.

When going to **Click here** text right below the templates, you will see the code of the template you have just chosen. You can customize and add [custom fields](https://metabox.io/series/custom-fields/) to the template using HTML, or delete the code and create a new one.
