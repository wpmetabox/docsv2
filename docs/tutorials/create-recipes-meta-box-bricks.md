We’re going to **create a recipe page** using **Meta Box** and **Bricks**. This page is a singular page of a custom post type and includes information that is stored in custom fields created with Meta Box.

The image below is a specific example.

## Preparation

In this case, the recipe page is the singular page of the Recipe post type. The recipe’s name and the dish's pictures are the title and featured image of the post. Besides, the remaining detailed information will be saved in custom fields.

In addition to using the [Meta Box](https://metabox.io/), make sure you already have these extensions:

* [MB Custom Post Types & Custom Taxonomies](https://metabox.io/plugins/custom-post-type/): It helps to create a custom post type that we need for recipes;
* [MB Builder](https://metabox.io/plugins/meta-box-builder/): It has a UI for creating custom fields right on the back end.

For the last one, we use [Bricks](https://bricksbuilder.io/) to build the page.

## 1. Creating a new custom post type

Go to **Meta Box > Post Types > New Post Type**.

After publishing the post type, you’ll see a new menu.

## 2. Creating custom fields

Go to **Meta Box > Custom Fields > Add New**.

Here are the custom fields that I created:

Pay attention to the **Video** field. Instead of using the **URL** field to save the video link, I use **oEmbed**. This field type allows us to display the video frame directly on the front end.

After finishing creating the fields, move to the **Settings** tab. In the **Location** section, select **Post Types** as **Recipe** to apply these fields to the post type.

Back to the post editor, you will see all the created custom fields.

## 3. Creating a page template using bricks

Go to **Bricks > Templates > Add new**.

Then, edit it with **Bricks**.

![Edit the template with Bricks](https://i.imgur.com/ZB1CuwK.png)

Go to **Settings > Template Settings > Conditions**> choose **Post Type > Recipes** in the list of options.

![Set conditions for the template to apply it to the Recipes post type](https://i.imgur.com/mGPukpK.png)

Choose a post in the **Populate Content** section to see it in the preview.

Now, let’s get the data and display the recipe in the template.

First, add a new **Container** element to cover all the recipe information.

Then, add a **Post Title** element to display the recipe's name.

To display the dish image and time, add another **Container** to cover them.

![Add another Container element to display the dish image and time](https://i.imgur.com/xRPdzD3.png)

For the dish pictured, add an **Image** element inside that **Container**. It is the featured image of the post, so in the settings of the **Image** element, select **Dynamic Data** and choose the **Featured image** option from the list.

![Add an Image element inside that Container element and select Dynamic Data to get the dish picture](https://i.imgur.com/Y1BJxhT.png)

For the time section to complete the dish, add a new container.

Instead of adding **Basic Text**, I’d like to use the **Rich Text** element to get information about the time. The **Basic Text** allows you to get the data only from the field. But, the **Rich Text** allows you to add the extra text along with the data.

![Use Rich Text element to get information about the time](https://i.imgur.com/r4mIfoj.png)

To get data from custom fields, click on the **Select Dynamic Data** button with a lightning bolt icon. Then, select the **Meta Box (recipe)** item and choose the field you want to display.

![Choose the wanted field to get the data](https://i.imgur.com/GBVvj0C.png)

For the **Ingredient** section, I’ll add a **Heading**. If you want to style this heading, set the HTML tag for it. It also helps you optimize SEO more effectively.

![Add a Heading in the Ingredient section](https://i.imgur.com/AYXklRB.png)

For this section's content, add a **Basic Text** element. Then, I also add dynamic data to get the data stored in the custom fields. Find the field name you want.

![Add a Basic Text element and then choose the wanted field to get the data from](https://i.imgur.com/qM62cPq.png)

For the **Instruction** section, I will add a **DIV** tag to cover all the information in the step and description fields. Then, I will enable a loop to show a cloneable field. In the **Query** section, get the data that I created in the custom fields.

![Add a DIV tag for the Instruction section](https://i.imgur.com/tvDvAng.png)

To display both the step and description fields, I use a rich text element. And get saved data from **Dynamic Data**.

![Use a rich text element to display both steps and description fields](https://i.imgur.com/3q4Mz8i.png)

For the **Video** section, I will add a **Heading** and **Video** element.

![Add a Heading and Video element for the Video section](https://i.imgur.com/mLC4owd.png)

To get the data from the created **oEmbed** field, go to the **Video** element, and change the source section to **Dynamic Data**. Then, search for the **Video** field you created.

![Change the Source section to Dynamic Data to get the data from the created fields](https://i.imgur.com/oGqeKJS.png)

I will do the same with other sets of information.

## 4. Styling the page

Just choose the desired element and change the settings in the **Style** section in Bricks’ template editor.

Here is the result.
