We will use custom fields to add extra information to the content analysis of Rank Math by using the MB Rank Math extension from Meta Box. It supports not only the Text, Textarea, and Wysiwyg fields from Meta Box but also **cloneable fields** (or repeated fields).

## Before getting started

First thing first, make sure that you installed and activated **Meta Box** and **Rank Math**. You can install Meta Box directly from wordpress.org or download it from [metabox.io](https://metabox.io/). 

You also need these extensions of Meta Box:

* [Meta Box Builder](https://metabox.io/plugins/meta-box-builder/): to have a UI on the back end to create custom fields easily.
* [MB Rank Math](https://metabox.io/plugins/mb-rank-math/): to allow Rank Math analyze content from custom fields created by Meta Box. 

Now, when you go to a post or page, the content in the custom fields hasn’t been added in the Rank Math content analysis yet. To analyze the content in the custom fields, follow this tutorial.

## Step 1: Configure custom fields

Go to **Meta Box > Custom Fields** and create or configure some fields.

No matter if the field is cloneable or not, you can add the custom settings as above. It always works.

## Step 2: Check the results in Rank Math

After completing creating custom settings, you can see the content of the field displayed in the Rank Math SEO Analysis. For example, Rank Math analyzes my content in the description field and displays the information about length, focus keyword, …
