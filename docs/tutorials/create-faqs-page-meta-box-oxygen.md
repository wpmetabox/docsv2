title: Creating an FAQs page - Meta Box + Oxygen

We are going to **create an FAQs page** using **Meta Box** and **Oxygen**. It has questions and answers that have been saved in custom fields created with Meta Box.

This is a specific example that we’ll create in this practice:

## Video version

<LiteYouTubeEmbed id='K0F-Mbiz_ls' />

## Preparation

For custom fields, we will use [Meta Box](https://metabox.io/) and [MB Builder](https://metabox.io/plugins/meta-box-builder/) to have a UI for creating custom fields right on the back end.

The FAQs page is built with [Oxygen](https://oxygenbuilder.com/). You should use its 3.9 version or higher, which has native integration with Meta Box.

The questions and answers are displayed in an accordion style on the page, which is provided by [OxyExtras](https://oxyextras.com/). This is optional only.

## 1. Creating a new page

Go to **Pages > Add New** to create a page for FAQs.

## 2. Creating custom fields

Go to **Meta Box > Custom Fields > Add New**. I’ll add a group with two subfields inside. It is also set to be cloneable to have more spaces to add different questions and answers.

Then, there'll be an **Add More** button to allow adding more Q&A on the **FAQs page**.

I also made this group **Collapsible** so that the information in the group field could be collapsed.

It’ll help avoid being messy.

After creating all the fields, move to the **Settings** tab, choose **Location** as **Post type** and select **Page**. Since we created the fields for the FAQs page, go to the **Advanced location rules** section below and select the page name.

Back in the page editor, you will see the fields and can fill in information about questions and answers.

## 3. Creating a template with Oxygen

In **Oxygen**, create a new template and choose the **inactive - Default Page** option to inherit its style and choose to apply this template for **Pages**.

Back to the **FAQs** page, assign the newly created template to this page in the **Render Page Using Template** section.

Now, let’s edit the template with **Oxygen**.

In the **Previewing** section, choose the page you want to see in the preview. Then, select a **Section** component to contain all of the FAQs information.

Next, add the **Pro Accordion** component. This component will only be available when you have **Oxy Extras** on your site. If you don’t have it, you can add **Text** components instead as normal.

Since I used Meta Box custom fields to save the FAQs information, I set the Accordion type as **Accordion - Dynamic Items (Meta Box)**.

You can input the value in the **Dynamic Data** section to show the questions and answers.

The group we used in this tutorial is cloneable, so add the group's ID into the box which I marked as 1 in the picture above.

The question will be the **Header Text**, so I added the **Question** field's ID in the box which I marked as 2. For the answers, I also input the ID of the **Answer** field and set it in the **Content field** box, which is marked as 3.

After applying parameters, the preview will show you all of the questions and answers.

Normally, to have a better score for SEO, the FAQs page should have schema markup.

The **Oxy Extras** supports the **FAQ schema** feature. Just go to the **Advanced** section to enable the FAQ Schema Markup.

![Go to the Advanced section of the accordion](https://i.imgur.com/w8gIjN8.png)

If you haven’t had the **Oxy Extras**, you can try the **Slim SEO Schema** to have the **FAQ Schema** following this tutorial.

Finally, click the **Apply Params** button to end the setup.

Now, on the FAQs page, you will see the result like this.
