We’re going to create a simple archive page to list all the posts of a custom post type. It’s called simple listing. Beside that, we will display extra information saved in custom fields of each post on this page.

This is an example that I made:

Since Bricks supports filtering posts easily, I will show you how to create a filter for the posts as well.

## Preparation

We’ll need a custom post type for restaurants for example. Each restaurant will be saved in a post of a post type. The name and images of the restaurant are the title and featured image of the post. Other extra information such as status, address and logo will be saved in different custom fields.

The page will have content and filters like this:

![How the page look like](https://imgur.elightup.com/da4gbL0.png)

For those filters, I use taxonomy to classify restaurants into separate groups and filter them by voucher.

So, there are some tools we need for this practice:

* **[Meta Box Lite](https://metabox.io/lite/)**: to create the Restaurant post type and taxonomy named Voucher to filter posts. Also, it provides a UI in the back end to create custom fields to save extra information about restaurants;
* **Bricks**: to build the page.

## 1. Creating a new custom post type

Go to **Meta Box** > **Post Types** > **New Post Type** to create a new post type for restaurants.

After publishing, you’ll have a new menu in your dashboard.

## 2. Creating custom fields and taxonomy

### Creating custom fields

Go to **Meta Box** > **Custom Fields** to create a new field group.

Here are the fields that I created. They’re just simple fields so just create them as usual.

![Go to Meta Box > Custom Fields > Add New to create custom fields.](https://imgur.elightup.com/aO8C8yI.png)

Remember to choose the **easy-to-remember** ID as we’ll need them in the next step.

After creating fields, move to the **Settings** tab, choose **Location** as **Post Type** and select **Restaurant** to apply the created custom fields to it.

### Creating custom taxonomy

As I mentioned before, we’ll use taxonomy to filter posts by voucher. So, go to **Meta Box** > **Taxonomies**, and then create a new one. This taxonomy will save information about restaurants’ vouchers.

![Create a custom taxonomy to save information about restaurant vouchers](https://imgur.elightup.com/prhx0w7.png)

When setting the taxonomy, if you want to display it as a column in the admin screen, go to the **Advanced** tab and tick the **Show admin column** box. It's available when you have [MB Admin Columns (optional)](https://metabox.io/plugins/mb-admin-columns/) on your site.

![Set the taxonomy to show as an admin column](https://imgur.elightup.com/YBAYvYp.png)

However, this is just an optional part so depending on your demand, you can choose to use it or not.

To apply this taxonomy for the post type you want, move to the **Post Types** tab and choose the **Restaurant**.

![Apply the taxonomy to a post type](https://imgur.elightup.com/M4mjX8Y.png)

After publishing the taxonomy, you will see it in the Restaurant menu. Just add terms for it.

![Create terms for the taxonomy](https://imgur.elightup.com/kg9jxoM.png)

Finally, let’s create a post for a restaurant, you will see the custom fields and the voucher taxonomy with terms appear.

## 3. Building the page

Since we’ll built the page with Bricks, create a new page and edit it with Bricks.

![Create a new page then edit it with Bricks](https://imgur.elightup.com/k7x4Vbs.png)

### Displaying the posts information

In the Bricks visual editor, add a **Container** element.

![Add a Container element to cover all the restaurants’ information](https://imgur.elightup.com/yB5g3EZ.png)

To display the title of the page, add a **Heading** element and change the name.

![Add a Heading element to display the title of the page and type the name of the page on it](https://imgur.elightup.com/1jDLbae.png)

In the container, add the **Posts** element then you will see a list of blog posts as default with featured image, title, and short description in the preview.

![In the container, add the Posts element then you will see a list of blog posts as default with featured image, title, and short description in the preview](https://imgur.elightup.com/PfbBkzB.png)

Since the posts we need to get are in the **Restaurant** post type instead of blog posts, go to the **Query** section of the **Posts** element, change the **Post Type** to the one we want.

![change the Post Type to the one we want](https://imgur.elightup.com/pvZ9Zmi.png)

Next, if you want to change the page’s layout or the display of the featured image, go to the **Layout** and the **Imgae** section.

![Change the page’s layout or the display of the featured image](https://imgur.elightup.com/NokwIHO.png)

Now, let’s get the data from custom fields to the page. Still in the settings of the **Posts** element, go to the **Fields** section.

![Add data from custom fields to the page](https://imgur.elightup.com/Lg0Zfdy.png)

I’ll remove the post excerpt and add some fields. Just click **Add Field** > type the name of the custom fields or the taxonomy you want in the **Dynamic Data**. Then, the data of each post will immediately display in the preview.

![Add field then choose a taxonomy from the Dynamic Data box](https://imgur.elightup.com/xu4e1iK.gif)

![Add field then choose a custom field from the Dynamic Data box](https://imgur.elightup.com/18b4jUh.gif)

For the logo field. It’s a bit different so pay attention to it.

When you add the logo field, it will display the text only. So if you want to show it as an image, **add an extra attribute** to the logo field as follows.

![Add an extra attribute to the logo field to have the image](https://imgur.elightup.com/KLRtNPs.gif)

Furthermore, since Bricks doesn’t support creating classes for the **Posts** element, if you want to style each information later, you can use the **HTML tag**.

Here, I set the restaurant name as **H2**, the address as **H3**, the voucher as **P** and the status as **div**. It’s good for SEO, so let’s set it.

![Set the HTML tag for elements](https://imgur.elightup.com/oS7wH3G.png)

After obtaining all the information, you can also rearrange them to the right order by dragging the fields.

That’s all for getting needed information.

### Creating filters

Go to the **Filter** section of the **Posts** element and choose the wanted taxonomy to classify the posts. Then, you will see it in the preview.

![Go to the Filter section and choose the taxonomy that you use to classify the posts](https://imgur.elightup.com/TEJSeK9.png)

All the filters and information have been gotten already. If you want to have more styling for the section, you can easily do it with Bricks.

In my case, I just change the layout of the **Container** and style a bit for the voucher and logo by adding some CSS.

![change the layout of the Container a little bit such as margin and padding](https://imgur.elightup.com/QrR2T2Y.png)

![change the alignment for the Heading](https://imgur.elightup.com/IXuUy0q.png)

In the event that you want to refer to my CSS code, I put it on [Github](https://github.com/wpmetabox/tutorials/blob/master/create-a-simple-listing-with-Bricks/custom.css).

This is how it displays on the frontend. The filters also work well.
