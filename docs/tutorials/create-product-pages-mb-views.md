title: Creating a product page - Meta Box + Gutenberg

import LiteYouTubeEmbed from 'react-lite-youtube-embed';

If you are using a theme without any page builders or just using Gutenberg, you can create a product page using MB Views.

I’ll take a car rental page for example:

## Video version

<LiteYouTubeEmbed id='DnKcWGkyhEQ' />

## Preparation

The product is a kind of custom post type. In this case, each car for rental will be a post of that post type. The product’s name and its descriptions are the title and content of the post. We’ll need custom fields to save some extra information about the cars, such as price, image gallery, type of fuel, etc.

![The product is a kind of custom post type](https://i.imgur.com/yv2kOpa.png)

For this practice, we need these tools:

* [Meta Box](https://metabox.io): provides a framework to create custom post type and custom fields;
* [MB Custom Post Type](https://metabox.io/plugins/custom-post-type/): to create custom post types for the product;
* [MB Builder](https://metabox.io/plugins/meta-box-builder/): to have a UI on the back end to create custom fields to save extra information of the product;
* [MB Views](https://metabox.io/plugins/mb-views/): to create a template for the product page without touching the theme file.

## 1. Creating a new custom post type

Go to **Meta Box > Post Types > New Post Type**.

Then, enter information and configure the post type.

## 2. Creating custom fields

Go to **Meta Box > Custom Fields**, then create fields as you want.

In this tutotial, I just take a typical example of car rental with some common fields. Here are the fields that I created.

Next, move to the **Settings** tab > **Location** > choose **Post Type** as **Car Rental** to apply these fields to this post type.

In the post editor, you will see all of the newly created custom fields.

## 3. Creating a template for the page

To display the product’s details, you normally have to go to the theme’s files to add code or use a page builder. However, you have another way with the **MB Views** extension to create templates for the product page.

Go to **Meta Box > Views** to create a new template. Instead of typing code into the box in the **Template** tab, you can insert fields to get their data.

![Create a Template and insert fields to get data](https://i.imgur.com/8TrA6p9.png)

Just click the **Insert Field** button and choose which one you want.

First, get the image gallery of the product, so insert the **Gallery** field and choose an image size for it.

Next, insert the product name and its description. They are the default fields of WordPress.

For the fuel, door, and gearbox information, because they are **Select** fields, you’ll have a setting where you can choose the output of the options as **Value** or **Label**.

Moving on, I’ll insert the remaining fields in turn.

In the **Settings** section of the view, set the **Type** section as **Singular** to assign this template to a single post page. Then, add a rule in the **Location** section to apply it to the Car Rental page only.

On the product page, all the product information is already displayed.

## 4. Styling the page

Before styling, let’s add some **div** tags to separate the page into different sections for easier styling.

Next, go to the **CSS** tab, add some code.

I also added some code in the **JavaScript** tab. This is to create a slider for the gallery.

All of these codes are available on [Github](https://github.com/wpmetabox/tutorials/tree/master/create-a-product-page-with-MB-Views), you can refer to it.

Now, you’ll see the final look of the page on the frontend. That’s done!
