title: Importing data into Meta Box custom fields - Using WP All Import
---

To import data into Meta Box custom fields, first install the [Meta Box Import Add-On](https://www.wpallimport.com/import-meta-box-fields/). You must also create the Meta Box custom fields and attach them to the desired post type or CPT before you can import data into them.

To start your import, navigate to **All Import** › **New Import** and use the post type or CPT with the attached Meta Box custom fields. Use the **Drag & Drop** screen to map and then import the Meta Box custom fields into WordPress.

## 1. Starting a new import for Meta Box custom fields

Navigate to **All Import** › **New Import** and upload your import file. Then, choose the post type or custom post type with the attached Meta Box custom fields:

In this example, we’re importing Meta Box custom fields into a “Restaurants” CPT. Proceed by clicking **Continue to Step 2**.

## 2. Validating Meta Box import data

Next, you’ll see the **Review Import File** screen, where you ensure that the data to import is correct and valid.

This section also lets you apply filters under **Manage Filtering Options** to further narrow down what to import.

Once you’re finished reviewing, click **Continue to Step 3**.

## 3. Mapping data into Meta Box custom fields

Next up is the **Drag & Drop** screen, where you can map the import data into their corresponding fields.

Import elements are mapped by dragging & dropping from right to left:

All of the Meta Box custom fields should be mapped inside of the **Meta Box Add-On** section:

Here, you can enable the desired field groups to import their Meta Box data. Here are some examples:

After mapping all the Meta Box custom fields, click the **Continue to Step 4** button (not shown).

## 4. Setting up import settings

Last, you see the **Import Settings** screen, where most import settings are defined.

The first step on this screen is to click **Auto-detect** to generate a unique identifier, though it can also be defined via drag & drop using the elements from your import file.

This screen also lets you control other import options, such as what happens should the import run again.

Near the bottom, you can also schedule your import and configure other advanced settings. Ignore these options for now and just click **Continue**.

## 5. Running import and checking imported Meta Box fields

Before running the import process, you’ll see the **Confirm & Run** screen, which lets you review a summary of the planned import actions before proceeding.

If everything looks okay, click **Confirm & Run Import**.

When the import finishes, you’ll see an **Import Complete** message:

That’s it! You can now review your newly imported Meta Box custom fields.
