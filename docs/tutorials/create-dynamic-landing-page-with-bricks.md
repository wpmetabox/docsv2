If you're struggling and spending too much time creating landing pages for multiple marketing campaigns, even when they have the same content structure, check out this article right away!

We have a comprehensive solution for these cases, named '**dynamic landing page**'. All you need to do is create a sample page with **content stored in custom fields**, and have a template for it with a perfect interface. Then, when having a new campaign, just **duplicate the page** and **change the content in custom fields**. You’ll have a new landing page with new messages without touching the template anymore.

I have a tutorial on how to create a dynamic landing page using Meta Box and Elementor that you may have read in a couple of weeks ago. Doing it with Bricks is in a similar way.

I will take a real case from our company as an example. We have another product, [Slim SEO](https://wpslimseo.com/). It has [Slim SEO Schema](https://wpslimseo.com/products/slim-seo-schema/) and [Slim SEO Link Manager](https://wpslimseo.com/products/slim-seo-link-manager/), two plugins for two different purposes. Each one has their own landing page. You can see that these pages have the same structure but different content.

![Example landing pages which have the same structure and different content](https://i.imgur.com/Cx6Lp2Y.png)

To have these two versions, we will use a dynamic landing page to minimize the effort.

## Preparation

The mindset will be like this:

1. Create custom fields to save all the content of the page. Each element will have its own field.
2. Create a template with Bricks for a sample page. In there: get and display data from fields
3. Clone the sample page  to a new one for using in a specific campaign.
4. Change the content in the custom fields, then have a new landing page.

We need the following tools for this practice:

* [Meta Box core plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/meta-box/): to have the framework for creating custom fields. It’s free, and available on [wordpress.org](https://wordpress.org/plugins/meta-box/);
* [MB Builder](https://metabox.io/plugins/meta-box-builder/): to have a UI on the backend to create the custom fields easily;
* [MB Testimonials](https://metabox.io/plugins/mb-testimonials/): a ready-to-use solution from Meta Box that helps to create a testimonial section with pre-built layouts;
* [Meta Box Group](https://metabox.io/plugins/meta-box-group/) and [MB Tabs](https://metabox.io/plugins/meta-box-tabs/) (optional): to organize custom fields into groups or tabs with a clearer structure;
* **Bricks**: to build the page.

## 1. Creating a new page

Go to **Pages** > **Add New** to create a new page as usual.

![Create a new page ](https://i.imgur.com/U1mWRwS.png)

I leave it blank since all the content will be put in the custom fields that I’ll create in the next step.

![Blank page ](https://i.imgur.com/EXVm3K3.png)

## 2. Creating custom fields

We will create custom fields for every element on the page and organize them in groups and tabs based on sections on the page.

![Organize custom fields in groups and tabs based on sections on the page thanks to Meta Box Group and MB Tabs](https://i.imgur.com/vQSKmeK.png)

For some kinds of content, you may use cloneable fields or cloneable groups.

![You may use cloneable fields or cloneable groups for some kind of content](https://i.imgur.com/5yBSvii.png)

Simply create the fields following your content structure. We have [more than 40 field types](https://youtu.be/WWeaM5vIAwM) for almost all kinds of data and layout, so just exploit them best.

Now, go to **Meta Box** > **Custom Fields** and create those fields.

![Go to Meta Box > Custom Fields and create custom fields](https://i.imgur.com/tYbRtw7.png)

To create tabs, just add a field with the type as **Tab**.

![To create tabs, add a field with the type as Tab](https://i.imgur.com/WpilwCU.png)

Then, add some fields.

![Add some custom fields for the Hero Section](https://i.imgur.com/o8OYYC6.png)

All the fields below the **Hero Section** tab field will be displayed in the tab.

For the menu on the landing page, there will be multiple items on the menu. Each one of them includes the label and its link. So I will create a cloneable group.

![Create a cloneable group for the menu since there will be multiple menu items, which includes the label and its link.](https://i.imgur.com/doN5AaP.png)

The sub-fields will be used to input the label and URL of each item.

![The sub-fields will be used to input the label and URL of each item.](https://i.imgur.com/mgIAaw5.png)

The button information will be in a group as well.

![The button information will be in a group as well](https://i.imgur.com/Gm07UT2.png)

Next, I add a new **Tab** field.

![Add a new Tab field](https://i.imgur.com/pIM6dKE.png)

Whenever you do that, it’s understood that the fields between the first tab field and this new tab field belong to the first one.

![The fields between the first tab field and the new tab field belong to the first one](https://i.imgur.com/YqKMHFk.png)

Continuing to create other custom fields. Just keep in mind the expected structure and create fields to follow it.

![Continue creating custom fields following the expected structure](https://i.imgur.com/dB8Wt6j.png)

For the content in the testimonials section, I’ll use the [MB Testimonials](https://metabox.io/plugins/mb-testimonials/) extension to build it, so I’ll create only a custom field for title, and another one for description of this section. All other content of this section will be created later.

![For testimonial section, create custom fields for title, and description.](https://i.imgur.com/bjgKSAl.png)

After creating all the fields, move to the **Settings** tab, set the Location as **Post type**, and choose **Page**. Since we created the fields for the landing page, go to the **Advanced location rules** section below and choose the name of the page we created in the previous step to apply all the fields to this page.

![Set location to apply the custom fields to the wanted page](https://i.imgur.com/6sUGBnl.png)

Go to the page editor, you will see all the fields.

![All the custom fields displayed](https://i.imgur.com/xUoBpks.gif)

Just input the content that you want to be on the landing page to the corresponding fields. I did it with some content for example.

![Input the content that you want to be on the landing page to the corresponding fields](https://i.imgur.com/KJWNdax.gif)

## 3. Creating testimonials

There will be a menu here when activating the [MB Testimonials](https://metabox.io/plugins/mb-testimonials/) solution.

![The menu of testimonials in the dashboard when activating the MB Testimonials solution](https://i.imgur.com/GZKvIWI.png)

Go there and add a new testimonial for your page.

This section is to add content of each feedback from your customers.

![The section is to add content of each feedback from your customers](https://i.imgur.com/qcwKIDK.png)

If you want to add more feedback from another person, just click the **Add more** button.

![Click the Add more button to add more feedback from another person](https://i.imgur.com/69WuymZ.png)

This **MB Testimonial** solution also provides some pre-built templates that you can opt for.

![Choose one of pre-built layouts of MB Testimonials solution](https://i.imgur.com/2nkzEC1.png)

Also can set some parameters for the styling.

![Set some parameters for the styling](https://i.imgur.com/ttD1vbn.png)

After publishing, there will be a shortcode automatically generated, just copy it since we will use it on the page.

![Copy the shortcode automatically generated](https://i.imgur.com/Bc0wwbR.png)

We had a useful tutorial on [how to use the MB Testimonials solution](https://docs.metabox.io/extensions/mb-testimonials/) to create and customize the testimonial section. You can watch it for more details.

## 4. Creating template for the landing page

Go to the page editor and edit it with Bricks.

![Go to the page editor and edit it with Bricks.](https://i.imgur.com/2iIKfYg.png)

My landing page will have its own header and footer, so I’ll hide these parts.

![The available header and footer of the page.](https://i.imgur.com/oEZSsNJ.png)

Go to the **Settings** section > **Page Settings** > **General** , disable the header and footer.

![Disable header and footer as my landing page will have them separately.](https://i.imgur.com/8S7v9YB.png)

The landing page has several sections such as header, hero, feature, pricing and so on.  Thus, we need to select the **Section** element to cover the information of each section.

![The Section element to cover the information of each section.](https://i.imgur.com/YPRA3xc.png)

There is an available container. We’ll add some elements inside this container to display the section information.

### 4.1 Displaying content from the stand-alone fields

We can add a reasonable element for the content that is from a stand-alone field (which is not in any group). For example, for the logo of the landing page, choose the **Image** element.

![Add a reasonable element for the content that is from a stand-alone field](https://i.imgur.com/6DnFe4b.png)

Since it is saved in a custom field created with **Meta Box**, use the **Select dynamic data** button to get the data form the corresponding field.

![Use the Select dynamic data button to get the data form the corresponding field.](https://i.imgur.com/GMuso4d.png)

![The corresponding field from Meta Box will be displayed.](https://i.imgur.com/emrJxLz.png)

### 4.2 Displaying content from the groups

For the content from the groups, you should use a **Div** element.

![For the content from the groups, you should use a Div element.](https://i.imgur.com/pGpXUkj.png)

Take the menu as an example. I have some items for the menu, and they are in a clonable group, so I need to use the query loop for the **Div**. In the **Query** section, turn on the button below and choose the type of data source as the group field where I put the menu items.

![Use the query loop and choose the data source in the Query section.](https://i.imgur.com/wuUMNkj.png)

To display the name of those items, add a **Basic Text** element. Use the **Select dynamic data** button and choose the right field. The field we should choose is the sub-field of the group that we use for the menu.

![Get the information about the subfield in the group field.](https://i.imgur.com/qtdJ7rr.png)

Then, all the menu items will display immediately.

![All the menu items will display immediately.](https://i.imgur.com/O6dRV7o.png)

Each item should be embedded with a specific link. Those links are saved in custom fields as well. So, in the **Link to** section > add **Dynamic Data** > choose the field where we save the links.

![In the Link to section > add Dynamic Data > choose the field where we save the links.v](https://i.imgur.com/h9dZykx.png)

So, please notice a rule about getting data from the custom fields.

* Firstly, for the **content from the stand-alone field**, just **add a corresponding element**, then **use the Select dynamic data button to get data** from the wanted field.

* Secondly, for the **content from the groups**, you should use a **Div** element and **use the query loop** for it to allow getting data from its subfields. Then add a reasonable element inside this **Div**, and add dynamic data from the wanted subfield.

Please keep in mind that we should follow this rule through all of this step to get full content from custom fields.

![Follow the rule through all of these steps to get full content from custom fields](https://i.imgur.com/vqh2IgM.png)

### 4.3 Styling something using dynamic data

There is a special thing about the button in the hero section. It has the color background stipulated in a custom field. So, you can add an attribute to regulate this button style.

![Add an attribute to regulate the button style](https://i.imgur.com/l5pYV1K.png)

You also can use dynamic values from custom field for this attribute as well.

![Use dynamic values from custom field for this attribute as well.](https://i.imgur.com/Zm2PMik.png)

### 4.4 Displaying the testimonial section

We also have a special section for testimonials. It has the section’s title and description from custom fields, so follow the rule.

![Follow the rule to get Testimonial section’s title and description from custom fields](https://i.imgur.com/P3e5tv0.png)

We created a testimonial with the **MB Testimonials** solution from **Meta Box** and copied its shortcode in the previous step. To get data from **MB Testimonials**, just add a **Shortcode** element.

![To get data from MB Testimonials, just add a Shortcode element](https://i.imgur.com/gVuKQ0o.png)

Then, paste the shortcode to the box as follows:

![Paste the shortcode to the box](https://i.imgur.com/bv7hnbg.png)

And this is our landing page on the frontend with all information displayed, including testimonials.

![The landing page on the frontend with all information displayed, including testimonials](https://i.imgur.com/iqtEfCf.gif)

The next work is styling this page.

## 5. Styling the page

Back to the page editor with **Bricks**. Then customize each element to style it in your own way.

You may want to add some CSS for advanced styling, it’s up to you.

![Add some CSS for advanced styling](https://i.imgur.com/YXru4pX.png)

This is the new look of my landing page.

![The new look of my landing page](https://i.imgur.com/9domRqm.gif)

I finished creating a landing page with dynamic content from custom fields. But it is just a sample. **It’s not for any specific marketing campaign**. To create one for a campaign, let’s go ahead to the next step.

## 6. Cloning the landing page for specific campaigns

When you have a new marketing campaign, just follow these steps:

1. **Clone the dynamic landing page** that we have just created to a new one;
2. Change the page’s content in custom fields, and you’ll get a new landing page.

To clone the page but keep its layout built with Bricks, we should use a third-party plugin named **Duplicate Page**. It’s available on repo. Just look for it and install.

![Look for and install Duplicate Page to clone the page but keep its layout built with Bricks](https://i.imgur.com/s9Ic1Ob.png)

There will be a new option to duplicate the landing page under the page.

![There will be a new option to duplicate the landing page under the page.](https://i.imgur.com/7RXHyF8.png)

Just duplicate it to any number of pages you want. I just created two to easily show you the concept.

![CDuplicate to any number of pages you want. ](https://i.imgur.com/KgOJ2z8.png)

Next, you should go to **Custom Fields** in **Meta Box**, and add location for the field group that we created for the landing page as the new pages.

![Add location for the field group that we created for the landing page as the new pages.](https://i.imgur.com/MlIdCY3.png)

Go to those pages editor, you will see that they inherit all the custom fields including data saved in them.

![The created pages will inherit all the custom fields including data saved in them.](https://i.imgur.com/vfP3Ixu.png)

Just change it to the new one matched with your new campaign.

![Just change it to the new one matched with your new campaign](https://i.imgur.com/HSxuwSs.png)

Go to the pages on frontend, you will see that you now have different versions of pages. Just different in content but the same layout.
